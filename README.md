# Python - PyBank and PyPoll


Completed two Python scripts: PyBank and PyPoll.

## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

* Created a Python script that analyzed the records, which then calculated each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* As an example, the analysis looks similar to the one below:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```
* In addition, the final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

![Vote Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

* Modernizing the vote counting process.

* Created a Python script that analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* Produced a complete list of candidates who received votes

* Calcualted the percentage of votes each candidate won

* Calculated the total number of votes each candidate won

* Identified the winner of the election based on popular vote.

* As an example, the analysis looks similar to the one below:

  ```text
  Election Results
  -------------------------
  Total Votes: 3521001
  -------------------------
  Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
  Correy: 20.000% (704200)
  Li: 14.000% (492940)
  O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
  -------------------------
  Winner: Khan

  ```
* In addition, the final script printed both the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.
